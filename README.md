# MUtation analySIs tool with high Configurability and extensibility MUSIC

## Compile

Before compilation of tool, clang v4.0 should be installed.

The current version of the tool has only been tested to compile and run successfully on clang v4.0.

After install and build clang, you have to edit llvm source and build directory specification in the following 3 lines of Makefile

```
LLVM_SRC_PATH := $$HOME/llvm
LLVM_BUILD_PATH := $$HOME/build-clang
LLVM_BIN_PATH := $(LLVM_BUILD_PATH)/bin
```

LLVM_SRC_PATH & LLVM_BUILD_PATH are directories containing llvm source and build respectively.

LLVM_BIN_PATH is directory containing executables (ex. clang-4.0, llvm-config, ...)

In short, according to the current Makefile:

	$$HOME/llvm` is the directory of llvm source.

	$$HOME/build-clang/ is the directory of the llvm build.

	$(LLVM_BUILD_PATH)/bin is the directory containing bin folder with all the executables.

Compile the tool using make to produce tool executable.

## Tool Options

```
./tool inputfilename [option ...]
```

### -o option

Usage: 
```
-o <directory>
```
Used to specify output directory. The directory must exist.

Default is current directory.

### -l option

Usage:
```
-l <int>
```
Used to specify the maximum number of mutants generated at a mutation location by a mutant operator.

Default is generate all mutants possible.

### -rs -re option

Usage:
```
-rs <line>[ <col>] -re <line>[ <col>]
```
Used to specify the range where mutation operators can be applied. 

Default is start of input file for â€“rs and end of file for -re.

They do not have to go together and can be used separately

### -m option

Usage:
```
-m mutation_operator_name[:domain[:range]]
```
Used to specify the mutation operator(s) to apply. 

Can be specified multiple times.

Elements in domain, range must be separated by comma.

## Output

In the output directory, there will be mutant files for each mutant and mutant database file named inputfilename_mut_db.

## Examples

```
./music test.c --
./music test.c -o mutant_test/ -rs 3 1 -re 15 5 --
./music test.c -o mutant_test/ -l 3 -m ssdl -m OAAN:+,-:*,/ -p compile_commands.json
```
